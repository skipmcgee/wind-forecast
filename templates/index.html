        <p>This is Theodore Norred and Skip McGee's project for the Model-Manager's company.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The Model-Managers company enables customers to determine which wind forecast models are
            most accurate for given locations over specified time intervals. There are a variety of wind
            forecast models (HRRR, ECMWF, GFS, MBLUE, etc. ) which often have different wind forecasts
            for a given location. Users of these forecast models usually cannot determine what model is the
            most accurate for their specific location. In other words, they would need to compare the model
            forecasts to actual data from weather/wind collection devices at specific locations to determine
            which model is typically more accurate for those locations.</p>

        <p>The Model-Managers company solves this problem by storing hourly wind forecasts for a
            standardized forecast period of 7 days in a database, and then allowing users to interact with a
            web interface to compare the forecast data against the actual measured data at a location for
            different time intervals. The 3 criteria used to compare forecast predictions to measured wind
            are average wind speed, wind direction, and wind gust speed. The Model-Managers company
            uses the free <a href="https://open-meteo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenMeteo API</a> 
            to obtain wind forecast data, and a <a href="https://api.holfuy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holfuy device API</a>
             to obtain the measured wind forecast data.
            The minimal viable product of the Model-Managers company uses 2 weather forecast models
            (HRRR and ECMWF) and 1 Holfuy device, located at La Bajada Ridge, New Mexico. The
            1Model-Managers interface is expected to be accessible by a minimum of 50 different users over
            100 times per day. Model-Managers uses a <a href="https://github.com/skipmcgee/wind-forecast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a> to manage their codebase.</p>
            
        <p>The entities that the Model-Managerâ€™s Database uses are Models, Locations, Sensors,
            Forecasts, Dates, and Readings. There will be more instances of Dates, Readings and
            Forecasts than any other entity, as we are limiting the MVP to one Sensor and 2 Models. Since
            there is one Sensor, that Sensor will be at 1 location for the MVP phase of the project. The
            Dates of the Readings and Forecasts will be taken hourly, so 24 times a day for approximately
            the next four months (each). This is anticipated to be around 2100 instances of each of the
            Dates, Forecasts and Readings entities.</p>
